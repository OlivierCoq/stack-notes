Take for instance a car. A car itself my be a car however it is made up of smaller individual pieces. Doors, a Windshield, a and a Radio all makeup properties of a car. The object also has methods of use. A car can be started, driven, refueled. etc.<div><br></div><div>Similarly in java objects exist to wrap common methods of use and properties into one object.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>example of a simple class in java:</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div id=\"COP2513-1610922690559-1610923742718\" class=\"editor\">public class Car{\n    //properties\n    public String make;\n    public String model;\n    public int year;\n    \n    // constructor\n    public Car(String instanceOfMake, String instanceOfModel, int instanceOfYear){\n        this.make = instanceOfMake;\n        this.model = instanceOfModel;\n        this.year = instanceOfYear;\n    }\n    \n    //method\n    public void Drive(){\n        System.out.println(\"The \" + this.make + this.model + \" made in \" + String.valueOf(this.age) + \" has began driving \");\n    }\n}</div><div>\n        <select name=\"languages\" id=\"languages\">\n        <option value=\"PT\">Plain Text</option>\n        <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n        <option value=\"C#\">C#</option>\n        <option value=\"C++\">C++</option>\n        <option value=\"Java\">Java</option>\n        <option value=\"JavaScript\">JavaScript</option>\n        <option value=\"Python\">Python</option>\n        </select> \n        </div><br>"}
